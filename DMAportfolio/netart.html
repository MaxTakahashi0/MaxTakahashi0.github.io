<p>This piece reflects on the lives of people who struggle to leave their homes due to societal pressure, who may even stay inside for days/weeks on end.
Specifically concerning those with mild/intense agoraphobia, social anxiety, or even COVID-19 anxiety, this topic is something that I wanted to attempt to bring to light from my perspective as someone who has struggled with similar issues.
The strongest feeling I want to convey through this project is that sometimes life is 2 steps forward, 1 step back. Things are always better on the other side of the tunnel, and you'll get there if you keep trying to work through your worries instead of ignoring them completely.
I am still an amateur at HTML/CSS programming for sure, so I was fairly daunted by this. But then I became set on adding elements of retro choose-your-own-adventure games and audio embeds which fueled my inspiration for this project.
